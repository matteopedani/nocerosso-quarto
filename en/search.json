    "text": "Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST): A Viable Solution for Energy Storage\nBuoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST): A Viable Solution for Energy Storage\nAmidst the ongoing global energy transition, there is a growing presence of intermittent energy sources on the grid, such as wind and solar. These sources necessitate efficient energy storage solutions for seamless integration. While batteries can provide short-term storage, there remains a need for technologies that can enable on-site weekly storage without the complexity of pumped hydro power plants.\nEnter Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST), which operates deep within the sea. BEST offers rapid response times, competitive efficiency, and scalability to higher capacities compared to existing battery storage systems. This technology can be employed for energy storage in small islands, coastal regions, or offshore wind systems.\nThe functioning of BEST is straightforward: intermittent electricity powers a motor connected to a cable that lowers a large pressure buoy deep into the water. During descent, kinetic energy is converted into potential energy due to buoyancy force. When needed, the buoy ascends, driving the motor and returning stable and predictable electrical energy to the grid.\nBEST could complement battery storage systems, providing the necessary weekly storage to balance intermittent energy. It represents a step forward toward a more sustainable and resilient energy future."

Solar energy and energy generated from ocean waves represent sources of renewable energy with great potential. In addition, fish and oyster farming is an important activity in the region of Sardinia, where the environmental conditions are favorable. In this article, we present a feasibility study of an integrated system of photovoltaic panels and wave energy generators for fish and oyster farming in open sea, in front of Oristano."

This complementarity makes the energy of wave motion the perfect partner for wind energy, as it greatly extends energy production.\nWe capture the movement of ocean waves and use it to create energy. The amount of energy created depends on the speed, height, and frequency of the waves.\n\n\nWave energy technologies\nFor over 150 years, systems have been patented to harness the power of ocean waves, and since the 1970s, increasing research has been conducted in this field to optimize and overcome the challenges associated with wave energy production. Currently, there are several well-established technologies for capturing wave energy.\n\nWe use “point absorber” “point absorbers,” which are floating buoys that convert the motion of waves on the water’s surface, and we use this motion to produce electricity through a linear electrical generator.\n\n\n\nRelationship between Power in KW and Velocity of the buoy in m/s.\n\n\n\n\n\nVolt/second V/s (Lejerskog et al. 2015)\n\n\nWe plan to build a field of buoys in the sea west of Sardinia, where recent studies (Vicinanza, Contestabile, and Ferrante 2013) have shown an average of 9 kW/m of energy can be obtained.\nFor more information about our products and services, please contact us at info@nocerosso.com We are at your disposal to answer all your questions."
