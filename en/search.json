    "text": "Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST): A Viable Solution for Energy Storage\nBuoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST): A Viable Solution for Energy Storage\nAmidst the ongoing global energy transition, there is a growing presence of intermittent energy sources on the grid, such as wind and solar. These sources necessitate efficient energy storage solutions for seamless integration. While batteries can provide short-term storage, there remains a need for technologies that can enable on-site weekly storage without the complexity of pumped hydro power plants.\nEnter Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST), which operates deep within the sea. BEST offers rapid response times, competitive efficiency, and scalability to higher capacities compared to existing battery storage systems. This technology can be employed for energy storage in small islands, coastal regions, or offshore wind systems.\nThe functioning of BEST is straightforward: intermittent electricity powers a motor connected to a cable that lowers a large pressure buoy deep into the water. During descent, kinetic energy is converted into potential energy due to buoyancy force. When needed, the buoy ascends, driving the motor and returning stable and predictable electrical energy to the grid.\nBEST could complement battery storage systems, providing the necessary weekly storage to balance intermittent energy. It represents a step forward toward a more sustainable and resilient energy future."

    "text": "Integration of Photovoltaic and Wave Energy Systems for Fish and Oyster Farming in Sardinia: A Feasibility Study\nThe growing need for electricity and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have led to the search for alternative energy solutions. Solar energy and energy generated from ocean waves represent sources of renewable energy with great potential. In addition, fish and oyster farming is an important activity in the region of Sardinia, where the environmental conditions are favorable. In this article, we present a feasibility study of an integrated system of photovoltaic panels and wave energy generators for fish and oyster farming in open sea, in front of Oristano."
